## I make videos about technology, and am currently trying to gain the knowledge necessary to make my *own* stuff. 

### I believe in an open internet, open-source software, and right to repair 
(however, for sake of honesty, there are many products I own which don't follow these principles, but I generally try to at least buy everything second-hand and do what's reasonable to reduce and reuse before recycling, and use Linux for as much as I can)

If you want to get in contact with me, my [email is here](mailto:contact@issacdowling.com), and the [the discord server is here](https://discord.com/invite/rmQX5984g8)
