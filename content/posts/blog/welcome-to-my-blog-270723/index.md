# Hello

## Why are you making a blog?
Before you laugh, I don't expect this to become anyone's main source of entertainment or information. I don't need my blog to become famous for it to serve its purpose.

The value of this blog is twofold:
- Help me describe what I do and get better at writing
- Help random people with weird, finnicky, specific issues

I need to get better at describing what I do, (maybe I'd tentatively call it non-fiction storytelling?) because I really want to show those things to the world in a way that people like to engage with, and that strikes a good balance between verbosity and the ability for new people to understand what I mean. Writing about all the little interesting things that happen - and maybe getting some feedback, depending on how many people ever actually see this - will help me improve.

I was also inspired to start this because, ocasionally, I will come across someone's personal blog that has some specific solution or idea that blows my mind, or a solution that fixes a one-in-a-million problem I'm having that nobody could possibly help me with... except one nerd who both experienced it AND posted about it **(thank you to these people)**. Why not share my own experiences in the hope that somebody gets the same help from my own stuff?

## Conclusion

I wanted to start a blog, so I started a blog. I hope you like it.
