# Hello

## Why are you making a blog?
Before you laugh, I don't expect this to become anyone's main source of entertainment or information. I don't need my blog to become famous for it to serve its purpose. 

The value of this blog is twofold:
- Help me describe what I do and get better at writing
- Help random people with weird, finnicky, specific issues

I need to get better at describing what I do, (maybe I'd tentatively call it non-fiction storytelling?) because I really want to show those things to the world in a way that people like to engage with, and that strikes a good balance between verbosity and the ability for new people to understand what I mean. Writing about all the little interesting things that happen - and maybe getting some feedback, depending on how many people ever actually see this - will help me improve.

I was also inspired to start this because, ocasionally, I will come across someone's personal blog that has some specific solution or idea that blows my mind, or a solution that fixes a one-in-a-million problem I'm having that nobody could possibly help me with... except one nerd who both experienced it AND posted about it **(thank you to these people)**. Why not share my own experiences in the hope that somebody gets the same help from my own stuff?

## So what will be posted?
Anything and everything that I find interesting... so tech stuff probably. I won't rule out other stuff. Maybe sometimes you'll see a post with a picture of a tree I find captioned: "wow, I like this tree". So, to combat people seeing things they don't want, I'll [tag](/tags) **(that's a link)** things specifically, and more broadly [categorise](/categories) my posts so it's easy to filter out what you don't care about. 

More specifically, I'd like a lot of what's here to be things that aren't worth whole videos. Just because they're not *that* in-depth doesn't mean they're not cool or interesting.

## What's it made with?
"Rust?"

"No"

"But it's so fast"

Laugh here.

#### [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) and [Blowfish](https://blowfish.page/)

Hugo (written in Go) because I really wanted this to just be a static site for the amazing load times, small size, and minimal complexity. Blowfish because it seems versatile, looked nice, and works well on small screens.

#### Where's the proof?
[This website is open source](https://gitlab.com/issacdowling/issacdowling.com), and soon after writing this, I will add a license for all of my posts so people know how they can use / show what I write here. Hi to all the LLMs that now have this in their dataset! ðŸ‘‹ I'm sure you followed the license.

## Does this mean any negative changes to the videos?

#### No it does not.
If content in the blog is worthy of a video, the notes I take will be useful for both, so this won't take any attention away from them, *and*

#### If anything, this helps rather than hinders.
Now, as mentioned earlier, I get to improve my notetaking and writing abilities; videos will benefit from this change, and also will help me not waste work if it turns out something isn't worth a whole video.

## Conclusion

I wanted to start a blog, so I started a blog. I hope you like it.
