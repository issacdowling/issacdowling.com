## About me

I love writing software, I love FOSS, and I love using Linux. My goal is just to write good software, and eventually find a job doing it.

I'm currently liking [Go](https://go.dev/) a lot, since it feels like the perfect compromise between performance / developer experience (both are great). Python is probably my most written language, but I really feel like Go isn't significantly harder to comprehend, but forces me to write better code (and _taught_ me why I should care about types more, which is _why_ I now use type hints when I do use Python).

I really enjoy writing C, and thinking about things in the lower-level way that it forces you to, but package management is unwieldly and the performance gains for my use-cases usually aren't worth it, so I don't use it often, but would like to get more used to it.

Elixir and Ruby are on my "do this since they seem interesting" list, along with the fact that I should probably be writing more JS/TS, but Go is just doing everything so well that I haven't gotten around to it yet.

Clearly, my personal projects are not the most ultra-optimised thing to meet Gitlab, but I very much enjoy the challenge of optimising things, and seeing the kinds of >10x improvements that can come from just rethinking a hastily-programmed problem. Getting data after doing things like that is massively enjoyable. Same goes with writing anything that _deals_ with large amounts of data, and seeing it complete tasks that would be completely infeasible for me to do manually.

If you're reading this, hopefully we've got something in common, since I doubt many people come to this blog, so if you have any cool projects that you'd just like to share, [don't hesitate to email me](mailto:contact@issacdowling.com).
