# [DIY Voice Assistant](https://gitlab.com/issacdowling/selfhostedsmarthomeguide)

### This was inspired by my Google Home refusing to do basic things without an internet connection, and me looking through all of its many recordings of everything I'd said to it. I didn't like that, but still wanted a voice assistant (and a chance to do something practical with coding)

#### The two main projects that this bases from are [Rhasspy (for bringing together services needed to run an assistant, such as text-to-speech)](https://github.com/rhasspy/rhasspy), and [Homeassistant (for providing me an interface to talk to smart home devices)](https://github.com/home-assistant/core).

My contributions are what Alexa would call "skills", as well as a guide for getting things done on a Pi. I've written things for getting the weather, playing music from a Jellyfin server, setting timers, etc. If you're interested in taking a look, there's a link at the top of this section, and there are videos [on the Youtube channel](https://youtube.com/issacdowling).
